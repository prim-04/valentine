    <p>Hi BBG,</p>

    <p>
        I wanted to take a moment to tell you how much I appreciate you. You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me, and Thank you for being there in my Ups and Downs.
        You may not have won the LAA but you've always won my heart bb. Please know that I'm always here for you and I will continue to support you in your journey. Continue to shine brightly and light your path in this world. 
    </p>

        Thank you for being my comfort, my laughter, and my favorite
        person in the world. You're my No. 1 
    </p>
